* Chapter 9 | Convolutional Neural Networks

Conv Nets are a specialized kind of neural network for processing data that has a known, grid like topology. Examples include time series data, which can be thought of as a 1D grid takings samples at regular time intervals, and image data which can be thought of as a 2D grid of pixels. 

The name convolutional neural network implies that the network employs a mathematical operation called a **convolution**. CNNs use convolution in place of general matrix multiplication in at least one of their layers. 

** The Convolution Operation

$$s(t) = \int x(a)$$
